Arrested Development


![](http://bukk.it/wow.gif)

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Obtain the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LucyMcGowan/arresteddev")
```

This package has 3 main functions to assist when you get stuck developing. It can 

1. Help you look up your error messages (`lmgtfy()` and `tracestack()`)
2. Help you learn some new fun R tricks (`teach_me()`)
3. Help distract you (`squirrel()`)


```{r}
library("arresteddev")
```

## Help you look up error messages

`lmgtfy()` (Let Me Google That For You) will take your most recent error message and google it. Similarly `tracestack()` will search your most recent error message on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (thanks [David]("https://twitter.com/drob)!). Simply stick it at the end of the code giving you grief.

## Help you learn some fun new R tricks

```{r, eval = FALSE}
teach_me()
```

## Help distract you

`squirrel()` will randomly send you to one of the following distracting websites:  
- https://twitter.com  
- https://xkcd.com  
- http://phdcomics.com  
- https://www.reddit.com  

or to a distracting website of your choice.

For example, this will send you to the Arrested Development wiki page.

```{r}
squirrel("http://arresteddevelopment.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page")
```
